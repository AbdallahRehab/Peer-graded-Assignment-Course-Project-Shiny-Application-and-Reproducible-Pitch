# This application allow the user to enter the side and height of square-based pyramid and we will calculate the volume and surface of a square-based pyramid.

#Two text box are created to enter the side of square-base, and the hight of pyramid and calculations for Volume and Surface Area (server.R) 

# To calculate the Volume and surface of apyramid, we need the next:

# Data: side, hight 

# Pyramid Volume <- 1/3*Base Area*Hight


# Surface Area <- Base Area + 1 /2 × Perimeter × SlantLength
