# Peer-graded-Assignment-Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch


## This application allow the user to enter the side and height of square-based pyramid and we will calculate the volume
and surface of a square-based pyramid.

##Two text box are created to enter the side of square-base, and the hight of pyramid and calculations for Volume and
Surface Area witch are done in the server.R 

## To calculate the Volume and surface of a pyramid, we need the next:

## Data:

# side <- a

# hight <- b

## Calculation:

# Base Area <- a*a

# SlantLength <- sqrt(b*b+a/2*a/2)

# Perimeter <- 4*a

# Pyramid Volume <- 1/3*Base Area*Hight <- 1/3*a*a*b

# Surface Area <- Base Area + 1 /2 × Perimeter × SlantLength<-a*a+1/2*4*a*SlantLength
